# TopSpin is a commercial puzzle made by Binary Arts. There is a circular ring 
# of N tokens from 0 to N-1 and a special section of the ring (the "turntable" or 
# "turnstile") of length K that can be "spun" to reverse the order of the K tokens
# in it. In this case, N = 14 and K = 4. In the physical puzzle, the ring of tokens 
# has to be rotated to get the token you want to reverse into the turntable. In 
# most computer encodings (including the ones here), the rotation of the ring is 
# not counted as a move, any K adjacent locations can be rotated, including locations
# that are adjacent by "wrapping around" from the end of the vector to the beginning, 
# e.g. there is an operator that reverses the tokens in location ..., N-1, 0, 1, ... 
# Because only the circular order of the tokens matters, in this encoding there are 
# 14 goal states which differ only in their cyclic rotation.

# Domain called "token" consisting of 14 constants.
